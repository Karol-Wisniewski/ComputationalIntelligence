In summary, for small inputs, in my opinion, the PSO algorithm was better suited. It achieved the same accuracy results in a much shorter time, and sometimes even better. As for medium and large inputs, the genetic algorithm performed better. Despite adjusting the parameters of the PSO, its accuracy was always lower than that of the GA. From the entire project, I concluded that these algorithms work in an incredibly interesting way, but at least in my case, not necessarily efficient.
