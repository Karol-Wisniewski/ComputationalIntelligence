Then, it goes through every element of solution (direction), checks possible edges that we can choose to go through and updates current node with the direction (index) of out edges. It also updates current path length by adding the new edge weight to it. Next, fitness converts the solution to a real path representing numbers of nodes in specific order to go through and checks if any node was visited more than once. If so, it punishes the fitness result harshly, as we only want result paths to be simple. It's worth to mention, that the algorithm selects the starting point itself for better results, because there may be more edges with possibly better paths coming out of node different than, for example the first one in given graph."
